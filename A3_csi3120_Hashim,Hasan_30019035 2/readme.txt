go to lexical analyzer to last few lines of the code
in this section of the code:
if os.path.exists("input'n'.txt"):
        in_fp = open("input'n'.txt", "r")
        getChar()
change 'n' with the input file you want for example

if os.path.exists("input9.txt"):
        in_fp = open("input9.txt", "r")
        getChar() 
       this one is for input9.txt

then go to the synatx analyzer file and go the topright of the vscode where there is a downward arrow next to the play button  where it says run python file press that and you should get the expected output in the terminal
